Curious soul. Always searching. Constantly asking.


I love knowing how things work: machines, art, ideas, tools, languages, or people.
Curiosity is what propels me to seek random pieces of knowledge. I often end up deep
down a rabbit holebuilding, breaking, and optimizing things waiting for that
addictive moment when the dots connect and everything makes perfect sense.



And yeah… I’m kind of addicted to it.

{{< timelineItem  md=true icon="palette" header="Mechanical Engineering ,Renewable energy · Agriculture" >}}


I’m currently pursuing my mechanical engineering degree, with a focus on renewable
energy and agriculture. I strongly believe that sustainable energy and food security
are two of the key drivers for a brighter future.



I code small things for fun or to solve real problems whether to help with studying,
language learning, or optimizing my digital workflows and minimizing friction.



I also spend a lot of time hunting tools, mods, and AI workflows. Even if I don’t use
them immediately, they tend to come in clutch later.

{{< timelineItem icon="palette" header="Art & Making" subheader="Drawing · Design · Carpentry" >}}

In my leisure time, I do pencil drawings or sketch ideas for friends using design
software like Inkscape.



I’ve also spent time doing carpentry in my backyard making tables, cupboards, pencil
holders, and repurposing scrap wood into useful objects. There’s something deeply
satisfying about turning raw material into form.

{{< timelineItem icon="palette" header="Languages & People" subheader="Deep talks & cultures" >}}

I love meeting people from different backgrounds and cultures. I’m fascinated by how
the human experience takes shape across societies.



I speak Arabic, English, and German, and recently started learning Mandarin. Each new
language unlocks a new world new people, new cultures, and new shades of human
experience.



I especially value conversations where you truly listen to someone’s doubts, dreams,
and inner world.

{{< timelineItem icon="home" header="What this site is"  subheader="A small corner of the internet" >}}

This isn’t a polished profile or social media presence.


It’s a small corner of the internet where I think out loud sharing things I find
useful or meaningful, and exploring ideas even when they’re still messy or
incomplete.



You’re always welcome here. Feel free to say hi.
